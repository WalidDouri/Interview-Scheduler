# Interview Scheduler

A single page web app that allows students to book time with interviewers in one of 5 hourly blocks from 12pm to 5pm, Monday to Friday.

Students can choose their day, select an hour time slot, select an interviewer and create the interview.

They can also delete their interview, edit their name and change their interviewer.

The main Scheduler app was created using React Hooks.
